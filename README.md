### 👋 Introduction
- 💕 Hi, I’m @lil-hammer6 -- aka Lilly Sencenbaugh I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Weed Science lab at Penn State University.

  
-  My doctoral research focused on the competitive dynamics and subsequent management of the invasive annual grasses Ventenata dubia and Bromus tectorum.
-  I studied how the two interacted in an addition series competition study, then repeated that design in a plant-soil feedback project.
-  My management work focused on the use of biofumigation (the use of bioactive byproducts from Brassica species) to suppress germination of these species and native species in a Petri dish dose-response study and a greenhouse emergence experiment.
-  Other work that is yet to be completed is a climate change study on ventenata using open top chambers and rain-out shelters to determine how invaded communities may change under climate change, and how response to a common herbicide ai (indaziflam) may differ. I've also worked on projects where we've combined the use of herbicides with soil-amendments, and was part of a long-term (seven years!) herbicide trial in improved pasture. 
-  I love working in natural systems and using a combination of statistical understanding and practical strategies to come up with effective field biodiversity research methods. 
- At Penn State I am getting started on looking at how weeds in cropping systems respond to cover crops to determine best practices for integrated management and prevention of herbicide resistence in soybean fields.
- I look forward to advancing my statistical knowledge and building upon my foundation with new techniques (like piecewise structural equation modeling!)
